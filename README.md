## Concepts Covered

The notebook explores 12 fundamental mathematical and statistical concepts:

1. **Vector** - Ordered collection of elements with direction and magnitude
2. **Matrix** - Two-dimensional array organized in rows and columns
3. **Probability and Probability Distribution** - Measure of event likelihood and distribution of possible outcomes
4. **Independent Variables** - Variables where the occurrence of one doesn't affect the other
5. **Expected Value, Variance and Standard Deviation** - Measures of central tendency and data dispersion
6. **Linear Correlation** - Linear relationship between two variables
7. **Mean, Median, Maximum, Minimum** - Fundamental descriptive statistics
8. **Quartiles in Statistics** - Values dividing data into four equal parts
9. **Boxplot in Statistics** - Visual representation of data distribution
10. **Histogram in Statistics** - Graphical representation of data frequency distribution
11. **Central Limit Theorem** - Foundation of statistical inference
12. **Derivative** - Instantaneous rate of change of a function

## Approach

For each concept, the notebook provides:
- Rigorous mathematical definition
- Simplified explanation with real-world analogies
- Practical examples and use cases
- Python implementations and visualizations

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Scientific Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]

# Navigate to project directory
cd philomathia

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook
```

Then open `notebooks/philomathia_final.ipynb` and execute cells sequentially.

## Usage

The notebook is designed for sequential execution:
1. Start with theoretical definitions
2. Explore simplified explanations and analogies
3. Run Python code examples
4. Analyze visualizations and outputs
5. Complete practical exercises

## Skills Developed

- Linear algebra fundamentals (vectors, matrices)
- Univariate and bivariate statistical analysis
- Scientific programming with Python
- Data visualization and graph interpretation
- Exploratory data analysis methodology
- Mathematical concept communication
